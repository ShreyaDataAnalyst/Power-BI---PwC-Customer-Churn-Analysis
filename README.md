## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of PwC Churn Analysis Dashboard in Power BI to identify high-risk customers, potential revenue loss, and service adoption trends, providing actionable insights to reduce churn and improve retention.




## Key Questions: 

1) Which customers are at high churn risk?
2) How much loss the company has to bear for the customer churn?
3) Which services area customer least signed up for?
4) Payment mode with highest churn rate?



## Steps Taken
1. Data Preparation: Ensured the dataset was clean, organized, and ready for accurate analysis.
2. Data Modeling: Structured the data in Power BI for optimal analytical efficiency.
3. Data Analysis (DAX): Applied advanced DAX functions to perform deep-dive analyses and uncover key trends.
4. Data Visualization: Developed an intuitive, visually compelling dashboard to make complex data easily digestible.
5. Insights Discovery: Unearthed significant insights that can guide strategic decision-making.

## Key Findings

1. Contract Analysis: Customers on two-year contracts tend to have longer tenures, while those on month-to-month plans are recent joiners, posing a higher churn risk.
2. Churn Risk: 7,043 customers are currently at risk of churning, with a 27% churn rate. This could translate into an annual loss of $16.06M in charges and $456.12K in monthly charges.
3. Support Tickets: A total of 2,955 tech support tickets and 3,632 administrative tickets have been opened.
4. Service Adoption: Many churned customers did not subscribe to services like Online Security, Tech Support, and Phone Services.
5. Fiber Optic Issues: Notably, 42% of churned customers reported issues with Fiber Optic Internet Services.
6. Payment Method: The highest churn rate is among customers using electronic checks, indicating potential concerns with this payment.
